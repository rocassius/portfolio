# Bikeshare Analytics Project
* Completed For MIDS W207: Fundamentals of Data Enineering
* Feedback from instructor: "Your writeup and analysis was one of the best!"

#### Problem Statement

- You're a data scientist at Ford GoBike (https://www.fordgobike.com/), the
  company running Bay Area Bikeshare. You are trying to increase ridership, and
  you want to offer deals through the mobile app to do so. What deals do you
  offer though? Currently, your company has three options: a flat price for a
  single one-way trip, a day pass that allows unlimited 30-minute rides for 24
  hours and an annual membership. 

- Through this project, you will answer these questions: 
  * What are the 5 most popular trips that you would call "commuter trips"?
  * What are your recommendations for offers (justify based on your findings)?
